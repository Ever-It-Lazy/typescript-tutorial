# Typescript Tutorial

The true focus of this project is to demonstrate familiarity with TypeScript.

The meat of it is a barebones drag-n-drop UI. There is no database. Initial values are hard-coded into the App.tsx. Refreshing the screen resets everything.

The app is deployed on Firebase.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
